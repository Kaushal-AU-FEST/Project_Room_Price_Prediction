# [House Price Prediction Project](https://home-price-predision-frontend.onrender.com/)

This project simulates the role of a data scientist working for a real estate company such as Zillow (in the U.S.) or MagicBricks (in India). The goal is to build a home price prediction system that estimates property prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location.

## **1. Define Problem**
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can estimate house prices based on various features such as area type, location, size, number of bathrooms, balconies, and total square footage. Accurately predicting house prices is essential for buyers, sellers, and real estate developers to make informed decisions.

## **2. Dataset Information**
- Dataset Source: [Bengaluru House Price Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data)
- The dataset includes features such as:
  - Square footage (`total_sqft`)
  - Number of bedrooms (`size`)
  - Bathrooms (`bath`)
  - Location (`location`)

## **3. Project Architecture**
### **Objective**
To develop a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various real estate features. Additionally, we aim to create a web application that provides predictions via a user-friendly interface.

### **Key Steps and Concepts**

1. **Data Preparation**
   - **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Extract meaningful insights from raw data, such as converting `total_sqft` to numerical values or extracting the number of bedrooms from `size`.
   - **Outlier Removal**: Identify and remove anomalies that could skew the model's performance.
   - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Optimize the feature set for model training.

2. **Model Building**
   - Use **Scikit-Learn** to develop a regression model for house price prediction.
   - Train, test, and validate the model to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

3. **Model Deployment**
   - Save the trained model using **Pickle** to enable reuse without retraining.

4. **Web Application Development**
   - Create a user interface using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
   - Develop a backend server using **Python Flask**, which will:
     - Load the trained model.
     - Expose **HTTP endpoints** for making predictions.

5. **Integration**
   - Connect the web interface with the backend server through **GET** and **POST** requests for real-time predictions.
